/**

 * http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9544734/cant-add-webviewfragment-derived-class-to-fragmenttransaction
 *
 * You cannot mix API Level 11 native fragments (android.app.Fragment) and Android Support package
 * fragments (android.support.v4.app.Fragment). You cannot create an android.webkit.WebViewFragment
 * and use it with an android.support.v4.app.FragmentActivity, because android.webkit.WebViewFragment
 * extends android.app.Fragment, not android.support.v4.app.Fragment.
 *
 * Either do not use ActionBarSherlock and the Android Support package, by creating an API
 * Level 11+ app, or do not use WebViewFragment (or copy it from the source code and refactor
 * it into your project).
 *
 * @JustLearningAgain: WebViewFragment is about 100 lines of code.
 * Copy it into your project, refactoring it into your own package,
 * and alter it to inherit from the support.v4 edition of Fragment.
 * I did this on one project (not yet released, or I'd point you to it),
 * and so far it has been working fine. â€“ CommonsWare Mar 3 '12 at 19:47
