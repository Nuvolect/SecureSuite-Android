We made SecureSuite because our own personal data was being snooped and exploited.We love our smartphones, tablets and web apps. Having our data in front of us is what we want, but there is one BIG problem. All of these free apps, are at best selling our personal information, or worst stealing our personal identity and spying on us. To use Android and use the apps, you must agree to certain Terms and Conditions, so the snooping may even be legal. But this does not mean you can’t protect your privacy. So what is the answer? Encrypt everything.SecureSuite is an encrypted environment for your contacts, passwords, calendar (future), notes, files (future) and todos (future). It's an Android app and web server that you carry around in your pocket. Your personal information is always on a physical device that you control and it's always secure.  If you have a second Android device such as a Tablet or an old phone, SecureSuite will maintain a mirror backup on the second device. If your phone is ever broken or stolen, you always have a backup. When you are sitting at your big screen Mac/PC, SecureSuite is a web app. It is the same work-flow as a combination cloud-Android solution, but there is no cloud and no internet access.For the security geeks SecureSuite is an open source Android app that uses an SqlCipher database, and a Nanohttpd embedded file server. Future versions will include an IOCipher encrypted virtual file system, a Mac inspired elFinder file manager, FullCalender and TODO Manager. It is an encrypted back end hosted on Android with a best of breed suite of front end tools using https 256 bit communications over your private WiFi LAN.To use SecureSuite, install it from Google Play, select Import/export, Import account, select one or more Google accounts and your contacts will be imported and encrypted. Set Settings, Entry lock, set a good passphrase or use your YubiKey Neo, and you are good to go. Your favorite contacts will be on the favorite list, initiate calls, text messages and emails directly from SecureSuite.  Sitting at your Mac/PC? Select SecureSuite, Server, and hit the “On/off” button. Enter the IP address into your browser and all your contacts will be at your finger tips on the big screen.In future versions the work flow will be the same for Calendar events, TODO items and even files. Are you a heavy Evernote, Dropbox or Google Docs user? SecureSuite can secure your files and index them with the Lucene search engine for real-time access.Secure doesn't have to be boring. SecureSuite was built from the latest in Android technology.Unlike other Android contact managers, SecureSuite is not just a set of new skins on the same old Android contact database.+ It is built using Fragments. This means it looks great on phones and tablets.+ It has 4 eye-pleasing themes to choose from.+ It has a Random Password Generator.+ It generates industry standard vCard, vcf files so you can share contacts with your associates.+ If you are a power user that uses accounts, groups, group emails and group SMS text, you will feel right at home.+ It lets you save an offline encrypted backup to your SD card, Dropbox, Google Drive or email.SecureSuite uses an obvious and minimal set of permissions. The app imports your contacts and can save vCards and encrypted backups to the SD card. It will reference an account to manage a software license. Most app developers abuse your trust by offering an app for free and then selling your stolen information later on. Nuvolect LLC is upfront about how it generates revenue. The only money made is through the honest consulting, grants and your donations.More information:+ https://securesuite.org
