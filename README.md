# SecureSuite Android

SecureSuite is a secure app for your personal contacts, passwords and notes, and in the future, for your calendar, ToDo lists and files.  

SecureSuite has an embedded web server that serves the SecureSuite web app on your WiFi network. 
You can either access your personal information directly on Android or over https on your WiFi network.
The concept is to provide a similar workflow to cloud based apps, without the security risks of storing your private information
in an Internet cloud.
Your private information is always with you, encrypted in your pocket and nowhere else.

The current stable release is on Google Play
